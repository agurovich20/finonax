# Known issues and deferred work

Items tracked here are non-blocking for the current milestone
and will be revisited explicitly when their cost exceeds their
deferral benefit. This is not a full roadmap (see ROADMAP.md
for planned features); it is a list of known imperfections in
shipped code.

## price() does not validate S_grid

**File**: `finonax/stepper/_black_scholes.py`

**Issue**: `price()` accepts an `S_grid` argument and assumes
it is uniform in `log(S)` and consistent with the stepper's
`domain_extent`. Neither assumption is checked. A user who
passes a linearly-spaced S-grid (not log-spaced) will get a
silently wrong result.

**Fix options**:
- Option A: have `price()` compute `S_grid` internally from
  stepper parameters + a user-supplied `S_center`. Cleaner
  API, no user error possible.
- Option B: add a validation check that verifies
  `log(S_grid)` is uniformly spaced with the correct
  `domain_extent`.

**When to revisit**: when the `price()` API stabilizes
(probably M2 or M3). Decide between options then based on
how users are actually calling it.

## ETDRK order=1..4 paths are untested in finonax

**Files**: `finonax/etdrk/_etdrk_1.py` through `_etdrk_4.py`.

**Issue**: These integrators were ported verbatim from exponax
(where they are exercised by many nonlinear PDE tests). In
finonax, only ETDRK0 is currently used (by `BlackScholes`).
ETDRK1-4 paths have no finonax-level tests. They are probably
correct — the ports are byte-identical to upstream — but
"probably correct" and "verified in this repo" are not the
same.

**Fix**: once a finonax stepper uses `order >= 1` (likely
Merton jump diffusion in M3, which requires the integral
term to be handled as a nonlinear function), add tests that
exercise that stepper and by extension the higher-order
ETDRK machinery.

**When to revisit**: M3.

## num_points is not required to be a power of 2

**File**: `finonax/_base_stepper.py`

**Issue**: `BackwardStepper.__init__` accepts any positive
integer for `num_points`. FFT performance is dramatically
better when `num_points` is a power of 2 (or a product of
small primes); arbitrary values like 1000 or 100 can be
~10× slower than the nearest power of 2 on GPU without any
accuracy benefit.

**Fix**: emit a soft warning (via `warnings.warn`) when
`num_points` is not a power of 2. Do not make this a hard
error — there may be legitimate reasons to pick specific
non-power-of-2 sizes (e.g. matching an external grid).

**When to revisit**: M2 (autodiff Greeks), when grid-scan
performance starts mattering.

## dtau is not validated

**File**: `finonax/_base_stepper.py`

**Issue**: `BackwardStepper.__init__` does not check that
`dtau > 0`. Passing `dtau=0` makes `_exp_term = 1` and the
stepper no-ops. Passing `dtau < 0` integrates backward in τ,
which for BlackScholes means option values grow exponentially
rather than decaying. Neither failure mode is caught; both
produce silently wrong results.

**Fix**: add `if dtau <= 0: raise ValueError(f"dtau must be
positive, got {dtau}")` at the top of `__init__`, alongside
the existing `num_spatial_dims` check.

**When to revisit**: next time `BackwardStepper` is modified
for any reason. Cheap fix, low urgency.

## Float32 execution paths are untested

**File**: `tests/conftest.py` (enables float64 globally)

**Issue**: The test suite enables `jax_enable_x64` in
`conftest.py`, which means every test runs in float64.
Nothing in the test suite exercises float32 behavior. The
analytical Black-Scholes module was explicitly refactored
to avoid forcing x64 at import time, which implies float32
users are an intended audience — but if a bug appears only
in float32 (e.g., catastrophic cancellation in the
`(exp(x) - 1) / x` form near zero), no test will catch it.

**Fix**: parametrize at least one representative test over
`dtype in [jnp.float32, jnp.float64]`. A good candidate is
`test_bs_matches_closed_form_atm`, with a looser tolerance
(e.g. `atol=1e-2`) in float32 to account for reduced
precision.

Specific note on calibration: users who import
`finonax.calibration` without first calling
`jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)` will silently
run in float32, producing warnings about dtype truncation.
Measured calibration accuracy in float32 (noisy-case MAE
~3e-4) is acceptable but noticeably looser than float64.
Consider either (a) enabling x64 at module import time
inside finonax.calibration, (b) documenting the requirement
prominently, or (c) both.

**When to revisit**: M2 or later. Low priority unless a
float32 user reports a bug.

## BaseNonlinearFun is a stub without concrete implementations

**File**: `finonax/nonlin_fun/__init__.py`

**Issue**: `BaseNonlinearFun` is an abstract base class with
a minimal `__init__` and an abstract `__call__`. Exponax's
upstream version additionally provides `fft` and `ifft`
methods that apply pre- and post-dealiasing, and concrete
subclasses like `ConvectionNonlinearFun` that implement
standard semilinear PDE nonlinearities. None of that is
ported.

For M1, this is fine — `BlackScholes` uses order=0 and a
trivial `_ZeroNonlin`. But any finance PDE with a real
nonlinearity will need the dealiasing machinery plus at
least one concrete subclass.

**Fix**: port the dealiasing-aware `fft` / `ifft` methods
from exponax's `BaseNonlinearFun`. Then port or write the
specific nonlinear functions needed by the target PDE
(`ConvectionNonlinearFun` for Burgers-like terms,
custom subclasses for jump integrals in Merton).

**When to revisit**: M3 (Merton jump diffusion or Heston).
Tied to "ETDRK order=1..4 paths are untested" above — both
gaps get closed at the same time.

## Greek tolerances in tests are absolute, not relative

**File**: `tests/test_greeks.py`

**Issue**: The five Greek tests use absolute tolerances
(5e-4 for delta, gamma, rho, theta; 1e-3 for vega). Because
Greeks have very different magnitudes (delta ~ 0.6, vega ~
38, rho ~ 53), a uniform absolute tolerance translates to
very different relative tolerances per Greek. The current
measurements happen to all be well within tolerance, but
the choice obscures whether each Greek is computed to
"comparable" accuracy.

**Fix**: switch to relative tolerance, e.g.
`abs(finonax - analytical) / abs(analytical) < 1e-4`.
Apply uniformly to all five Greeks. Adjust constants if
needed once measurements are taken.

**When to revisit**: M2.3 (parameter-grid Greek validation),
when many measurements at varying magnitudes will make the
case for relative tolerance more compelling.

## HestonStepper uses forward Euler time stepping

**File**: `finonax/stepper/_heston.py`

**Issue**: The HestonStepper uses explicit forward Euler
integration in tau. This is conditionally stable, with the
stability bound

    dtau <= 4 / (v_max * k_max^2)

where k_max = pi * num_x / (2 * x_half_extent) is the highest
spatial wavenumber on the log-spot axis. For canonical equity
parameters at num_x=512, x_half_extent=3.0, this caps v_max
at roughly 0.22 for num_steps=2000.

This limits HestonStepper to moderate-volatility regimes. For
high vol-of-vol calibration or long maturities where v_max
must be larger, num_steps must scale as v_max * num_x^2,
which becomes impractical for realistic parameter ranges.

The current test parameters (v_max=0.20, num_steps=2000) sit
near the stability edge: they pass cleanly but any change
that increases v_max, num_x, or dtau will break them.

**Fix options**: implicit time stepping (Crank-Nicolson in tau)
or ADI (alternating direction implicit) splitting. Both add
significant implementation complexity and are deferred until
a use case requires them.

**When to revisit**: M3c.4 (Heston calibration) may require
this if optimization wanders into high-xi parameter regions
that demand larger v_max for accuracy. Watch for instability
during calibration; if it appears, switch to an implicit scheme.
